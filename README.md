# NetGalaxy

Explore new worlds and solve problems along the way in NetGalaxy. The interactive piece challenges the userâ€™s determination to never give up. The events in NetGalaxy present an issue, a set of items that need to be addressed, and a text box. It is up to the user to figure out how they will solve the problem, the only requirement is that they include all the items that need to be addressed. This experience was based on my fear of never being good enough for a programming job. I consider myself an experienced programmer, however, the job descriptions still haunt me. As I was working on NetGalaxy, I realized that my willingness to fight for what I wanted matter the most. 

This was my first introduction to Three.js and I was able to quicky pick up in two weeks of work. The website is simple, but I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.
